        <p> The first Wheeler that came into America settled in Concord (Massachusetts) about the
          year 1630. He had several sons &amp; one of them came to Black Rock and at the old Lot
          built a stone house with a flat roof of Plank on which he mounted two four-pounders,—one
          pointed towards the Mouth of the Harbor &amp; the other at an Indian fort situated at the
          head of the harbor, now known by the name of Old Fort.</p>
        <!--   for images in the text place this code

        <p>This place the Fairfield Indians had built for their defence against some of the interior
          tribes with whom they were perpetually at War. It was composed of Palisades joined
          together &amp; at each corner a room was built out with portholes like the following
          figure: <!-- add image of fort here-->
        </p>
        <p> It contained about an acre of land &amp; was garrisoned by about 200 Indians fond of War
          &amp; often solliciting the Old Indian for leave to destroy the English. Once they
          obtained it on condition of pulling up a large neighboring White Oak Tree-</p>
        <p> Well, to work they went &amp; stript off its branches, but still the trunk baffled their
          utmost endeavours.</p>
        <p>"Thus" says the Old Sachem , "will be the end of your War—you may kill some of their
          papooses, but the old plaguey Stump t'other side of the great Waters will remain &amp;
          send out more branches—" </p>
        <p> It happened one time that 6 of the Mohawk tribe, being closely pursued by the Fairfield
          Indians were secreted by one of the Waklins of Stratfield under some sheaves of Flax,
          &amp; being directed homewards, were the occasion of the long Amity that subsisted between
          that tribe and the English.—</p>
        <p> Many remains of the Indians are daily discovered, as Stone arrows, hatchets, etc. In
          Greenfield is a Samp Mortar made in the solid rock, containing nearly half a Bushel. </p>
        <p> A pot has been seen in Weston of Stone &amp; a stone bottle was found very curiously
          made, holding about half a pint, at Black Rock some years since. A great part of their
          food seems to have been Oysters, Clams &amp;c. by the vast beds of Shells that are
          frequently dug out of the Earth. </p>
        <p> My Grandfather had (I learn from tradition, there being no journals left of those times)
          many brothers &amp; sisters, 14 in all. </p>
        <p> Hannah, the youngest, was a very intelligent person— about 18 years of age. She was
          courted &amp; expected to be married to Ringfield a Captain of a ship who gave her a gold
          ring, 3 pair of green silk stockings &amp;c, but he being gone for so long, she was
          courted &amp; married by Sam Wheeler. </p>
        <p> On the day of their marriage, a Ship appearing taken for Ringfield by the Bride, she
          burst into tears &amp; declared she would not be married, &amp; half dressed hid in a hole
          in the back kitchen of my grandfather who, with horsewhip in hand, dragged her out, but
          she ran around him as he attempted to strike.—</p>
        <p>They finally concluded to dispatch a boat to see who commanded said ship. Finding it was
          not Ringfield (who was lost) she was married, but never could the Capt. be erased from her
          mind, as (I am told by a person who was eye wit- ness) she used frequently at 75 years of
          age to weep over his presents.</p>
        <p>1740 &amp; 1741</p>
        <p> was the Hard Winter. The Ground, covered with Snow to the tops of the fences for 40
          days. It did not thaw the least on the sunny side of the House.</p> (footnote: Waklin,
        original form of present Wakelee and Wakeley name. Sergeant Samuel Wheeler was son of Deacon
        Isaac Wheeler.) <p> A snow fell about the middle of December which filled the roads &amp;
          buried a pair of Oxen at the old fort, owned by Sam Gold. They were found by their
          breathing holes. The harbour continued frozen from that time till the middle of May— Capt.
          Bostwick &amp; Capt. Dimon were loading for the West Indies. Dimon said as winter set in.
          Bostwick was ready, but delaying one night, was froze in &amp; had to cart hay to his
          stock for 3 months. When going out of the Sound, he found Dimon returning.</p>
        <p>(From sketch of Mrs. Jonathan Wheeler.) She was remarkable for storytelling. In her
          father's days she said the Sound was froze over and her father went half way to Long
          Island when it began to break up. He being an active man, sprang from one cake to another
          till he got ashore. It used to be so cold as to freeze cattle's mouths up &amp; they would
          have to get a teakettle of hot water to thaw them out. It used in winter time to freeze
          people's voices, and in the Spring when a thaw came there would be all kinds of noises
          heard in the air.</p>
        <p>1753</p>
        <p> In June &amp; July the bloody Flux raged to such a degree that 2 or 3 were buried in
          Fairfield daily (of the dysentry)</p>
        <p> 1758 March 22—Earthquake in New England.</p>
        <p> 1763</p>
        <p> The dry summer—begun very early—everything parched up— Old pasture spring dug.</p>
        <p> 1767</p>
        <p> August—Two Indians were whipt &amp; stood in the Pillory for stealing a child &amp;
          leaving it in the fields.</p>
        <p> 1768</p>
        <p> Isaac Frazier, a noted thief, was hung at Fairfield.</p>
        <p> 1771</p>
        <p> July—The Lightning struck Stratfield meetinghouse &amp; killed uncle John Burr &amp;
          ripped open the Shoes of his brother Ozias that stood near him &amp; killed likewise David
          Sherman.</p>
        <p> 1772</p>
        <p> March 7—Snow storm, (this month seven large snow storms—the 2nd day of April snow higher
          than the fences.</p>
        <p> Sept. 2—In the evening 2 black clouds appeared in the South- West &amp; North-West,
          &amp; one seemed to come &amp; meet them directly over Fairfield from the North East—at
          half past Eight it began to thunder incessantly. The flashes of Lightning, which seemed to
          set the room in a blaze, were about a minute's distance from each other, accompanied with
          bursts of Thunder like the whole broadside of a Ship, making the Earth to tremble and at
          the same time lifting one of our family from the seat at the side of the house onto her
          feet. At the same time the room was filled with a sulphurous smell. </p>
        <p> (Struck Abel Wheeler's house twice and his signpost once— It was a tavern where much
          vice was seen) Abel Wheeler got up, it struck him down; then they all stood up &amp; were
          struck down—The Lightning ran in streams all through the Rooms, broke all the lower
          windows, but hurt none of the people.</p>
        <p> Down rushed the Rain, impetuous as if the floodgates of heaven had been opened.</p>
        <p> Many thought it was the World's last Session &amp; trembling sat, expecting every Breath
          to be the last for 3 long hours; but at 1/2 past 11 it ceased.</p>
        <p>They all agree that the Storm tonight has been the hardest one that e'er this Land has
          seen. It must as nigh as we could guess Strike 90 times about this Place. A Barn was
          struck &amp; burnt in Town.</p>

        <p> Revolutionary War</p>
        <p>"And seald is now each life that could have told" Byron—Lara.</p>
        <p> I have always regretted that I did not keep a journal of the War which beeon in 1775,
          being then 13 years of age, whereas I began to write 1780. (Autobiographical sketchbook,
          from which indented entries are quoted.)</p>
        <p> 1774</p>
        <p> June—Boston Port shut up—Connecticut people contributed for their relief.</p>
        <p> 1775</p>
        <p> April 19—War between Britain &amp; America began.</p>
        <p>1776</p>
        <p> Independency declared.</p> 1777 <p> April 24—Eighteen Sail landed at Compo 2,500 Men who
          marched up thro Greenfield &amp; North Fairfield to Danbury, stayd there one night,
          destroyed the Stores of Provision. Our people collected &amp; Gen. Arnold built a
          breastwork in Ridgefield &amp; with 250 men stopt the whole army for 15 minutes. On our
          side lost Col. Gould &amp; a considerable number more were killed.</p>
        <p> I perfectly remember the expedition of the enemy to Danbury (1777) &amp; was at work in
          my father's garden when our people met them at Ridgefield where a temporary breastwork was
          thrown up of rails &amp; behind which 250 patriots were posted under the command of Gen.
          Arnold who sustained the fire of the whole British army (2200 picked men) for 15 minutes
          till the flank guards came round the corner of the house that stood by the side of the
          road where they were engaged—</p>
        <p> Arnold, mounted on a horse, rode up to the breastwork and encouraged our men to fight
          until his horse was shot dead under him—the soldier that shot the horse running to take
          Arnold, he while dropping, snatched his pistol from the holster and brought him to the
          ground with "Damn you, take that!"</p>
        <p>My wife had a greatuncle (David Patchin) an experienced marksman at shooting pigeons
          every fall, who was used to such sport as this, having been in the old French war,—when
          under Abercrombie. His righthand man (as he has often told me) was shot down twice in one
          day &amp; then he had seven shots when he took as he said as good sight as ever he did at
          pigeons,—the last time at one that came round the comer of the house about 3 rods
          distance. He saw him drop, &amp; then, under cover of the smoke of the whole volley which
          the British poured in upon them, retreated, &amp; when that left him, skulked behind a
          rock where the balls struck spat! spat! spat! in the manner of hail; but soon under cover
          of more smoke, he came off safely ...</p>
        <p> The place where they retreated was a cleared spot through an orchard,—no cover—&amp;
          there Col. Gould of Fairfield was shot &amp; was buried next day with the honors of war,
          three volleys being fired over his grave ... (He married my mother's sister.)</p>
        <p> The firing was distinctly heard at Black Rock from Ridgefield and caused many melancholy
          sensations—</p>
        <p> Gen. Wooster endeavored to attack them in their rear, but his men would not come on,
          &amp; there he was killed, being near 70 years of age.</p>
        <p>"To the immortal memory of the Generals Warren, Montgomery, Mercer, Herkimer, Nash,
          Wooster, and all the renowned heroes that ever bled &amp; died in the defence of their
          country"—was a toast given about that time that is now fresh in my memory.</p>
        <p> 1779</p>
        <p> April 25—A boat load with 8 or 10 men landed against Old Fort at the head of Black Rock
          harbor in the night &amp; marched up to Gen. Silliman's &amp; took him &amp; his son
          William through the broken place in the beach to Long Island, then in possession of the
          enemy. They were piloted by one of our own (Tories). As they passed over the beach, the
          old 12 pounders at the battery three times distinctly in a calm night made the windows of
          my chamber shake. We were soon out, expecting the next moment to be a prisoner, but
          sending to the battery we learned the cause. The next morning the tracks of 8 men were
          discernible; 2 traced to the house of Ezra Wheeler, the next neighbor, who was tried for
          life before Putnam (then cantoned at a wood in Redding for the convenience of fuel in
          winter)—he was liberated.</p>
        <p> July 7—At 7 in the morning, the fog clearing off, the enemy's fleet, just returned from
          plundering New Haven, appeared. Three guns announced an alarm—everyone busy in moving or
          throwing their things out of doors. About 11 o'clock 1,600 regular troops landed at the
          foot of the bar on town beach. Isaac Jarvis commanded the battery at the point of Grover's
          Hill, Black Rock, who, as soon as the British turned to go up the beach lane, fired a
          12-pounder with ball &amp; grape- shot, &amp; kept it going till it was so hot you could
          hardly bear your hand thereon.</p>
        <p>As they approached the parade, a field piece let go a ball &amp; grapes through them.</p>
        <p>I was at that time on Toilsome Hill, having been just above with my father to drive
          cattle to our woodland, to keep them from the enemy. As we arrived at Black Rock, it was
          with no pleasant sensation we heard the firing back towards Barlow's-plain, &amp; seemed
          to be in danger of being hemmed in—this, however, we prevented by taking the upper
          bridge.</p>
        <p>Black Rock people soon assembled on Grover's hill, among whom were several females, where
          we could see the enemy marching up. A continual cracking from near Round-hill was kept up
          the remainder of the afternoon &amp; sometimes from a field-piece.</p>
        <p>The first building that appeared on fire was the guard-house at Kenzy's point; next one
          at Barlow's plain. You might from Black Rock see the fire shine through the windows &amp;
          presently the fire on the outside. </p>
        <p> At night the British placed guards round the town which were plainly seen by the burning
          houses,—while many a column of Fire from the flaming buildings &amp; frequent flashes of
          Lightning from a western cloud with dis- charges of cannon &amp; musquetry formed a
          Prospect the most Gloomy &amp; comfortless imaginable to the poor inhabitants who, many of
          them sheltered only by the Canopy of Heaven, without a second Suit to their backs, or a
          Penny in their Purse, beholding from a Distance the fruit of all their toil &amp; labor
          expiring in a Cloud of smoke &amp; cinders.</p>
        <p>April 25—Ezra Wheeler's brothers Josiah and Abraham, as Tones, had their estates
          confiscated subsequently, but Ezra Wheeler remained in Black Rock and served as a member
          of the battery guard in 1779.</p>
        <p> The town burnt all night—a cloud seemed to remain fixed in the west, from which issued
          frequent flashes of lightning; this, joined to many a column from the flaming buildings
          &amp; frequent discharges of cannon &amp; musketry on the British guard placed around the
          town; the poor inhabitants, with no shelter, with no clothing but what they had on; wives
          separated from their husbands &amp; exposed to the indecencies of an infuriated soldiery,
          rendered truly diabolical by the spirits they found in plenty in the town,—formed a scene
          altogether so shocking that Fairneld will never see again, nor her present silken sons
          &amp; daughters can form any conception of.</p>
        <p> There were some instances of great bravery among the inhabitants of Fairfield. A Mr.
          Tucker fired from his shop on the parade at the whole army only a few rods distant, &amp;
          was wounded by them in the shoulder &amp; taken prisoner. Mr. Parsons fired from a chamber
          into the road &amp; killed a British officer; then running out the back door made his
          escape. The enemy coming into the house, found an old negro bed-ridden; they said it was
          him, he declared it was not; they put the bayonet into him &amp; burnt the house, next day
          my brother saw him about half burnt up &amp; a beam lying on him.</p>
        <p> Parsons, after this taking a prisoner, was conducting him away when he was taken
          prisoner himself.</p>
        <p> Joseph Gold, a very old man &amp; feeble, going off, stopped at a spring to drink; they
          commanded him to stop; he would not; they shot him.</p>
        <p> Several women stayed in town to save their houses; but were so frighted, they said they
          would never again stay.</p>
        <p> Jonathan Bulkley, living on the Green, stayed, got a protection from General Tryon &amp;
          saved his house &amp; three adjoining houses.</p>
        <p> July 8—A Row-Galley, mounting an 18-pounder of brass, lay 5 of a mile from the Battery,
          &amp; fired upon it, sending some shot over the hill; &amp; the Battery firing on them,
          &amp; hallooing with a speaking trumpet to turn their broadside towards them &amp; they
          would give it to them.</p>
        <p> Isaac Jarvis commanded at the Battery. Had he been a coward, 10 more houses would have
          been burnt; Squire's, Burr's, Silliman's, Holbertons, Fowler's, Chauncy's, Widow
          Wheeler's, Ichabod Wheeler's, E. Wheeler's, Bartrams.</p>
        <p> About noon the enemy returned on board at Kenzy's Point, &amp; were pursued through the
          burning houses by enraged inhabitants, and at Sandy Lane the roar of the small arms was
          continued like the roll of a drum.</p>
        <p> Our people would have paid them as they were embarking, had they not levelled all the
          stone walls near the shore where our men might get behind, &amp; drew up their armed
          vessels to keep off the Americans.</p>
        <p> It is said the Fairneld people fought much better than they did at New Haven or Norwalk,
          which was burnt soon after.</p>
        <p> Map of fairfield 1779</p>
        <!--Italics here        -->
        <p> When the British burned FairEeld this map was made for or by Lieutenant Lawru of the
          invading army,—hence the military accuracy of the details of gunrange and position of
          troops,—and hence also the many inaccuracies in the topography of the
          hinterland—unfamiliar, of course to a British observer. "This manuscript map is reproduced
          by courtesy of Louis F. Middlebrook, author, and of The Essex Institute, publisher, from
          "Maritime Connecticut in the American Revolution 1775-1783."</p>
        <!--     Italics end   -->
        <p> About 40 of the enemy were found dead &amp; 8 or 10 of ours. No doubt many were wounded
          &amp; carried off with them, for about a fortnight after, when on guard at the point, I
          observed the remains of one washed out of the sand where they had buried him.</p>
        <p> Eighty dwelling-houses, besides barns, stores, etc. were consumed. A Presbyterian
          meeting-house, Episcopalian Church &amp; a Court-house, Green's Farms with their
          meeting-house, &amp; Mill River (Village) were burnt at the same time.</p>
        <p> Eleven houses were left standing, some of them extinguished by our people who followed
          close at the heels of the English, &amp; afforded a refuge to the poor inhabitants from a
          hard succeeding winter, the most terrible but one (1740) ever seen since the settlement of
          New England.</p>
        <p>The severe cold quieted in some measure our fears from an attack, &amp; made the enemy in
          New York tremble in their turn for fear our men should march on the ice &amp; attack
          them—&amp; affording us a long season of excellent sleighing.</p>
        <p>Thus graciously did a kind Providence favour &amp; defend us from an unrelenting foe,
          till they were tired out by the contest.</p>
        <p>The Sabbath after, Mr. Eliot preached (from 'Our holy &amp; our beauti- ful house, where
          our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid
          waste') at Holland Hill* <italic>(William Wheeler's recollection seems here at variance
            with the Parish register held states that the church service of July 11th after the
            burning of Fairfield was held at the house Deacon Bulkley—which was one of the few
            houses near the Green left standing. Services on subsequent Sundays were held at Deodate
            Silliman's and other houses.)</italic> where Fairfield people assembled, not daring to
          meet near the shore for fear of being taken prisoners, so fearful were they—&amp; long
          after, they could hardly sleep in their beds.</p>
        <p> My father had a place for his silver tankard &amp; some silver therein, in a stonewall.
          Many a time he has gone in a dark night with his gun to see if no enemy's boat came over
          the beach. <italic>(July 8 -The silver tankard, hidden by Captain Ichabod Wheeler, is now
            in the collection Historical Society in Fairfield.</italic>
        </p>
        <p>Sometimes very few guards at the Battery or anywhere else. Strange that the enemy did not
          burn us in the four long years that the war lasted after this time. I listed as a soldier
          in the Guard (Upper Wharf) from May 16th till July 7th, when Fairfield was burnt, being 16
          years of age. We had a double fortified 3 pounder, which sent a shot over a boat of the
          enemy's, sounding at the broken place of the beach."</p>
        <p> About a fortnight after the Fire, I was drafted to go upon Guard a fortnight in town. We
          kept Guard upon the Beach &amp; Kinsey's point,—3 sentrys at each place. One night as we
          were on Guard, we heard a Boat row, &amp; ran to the Shore &amp; lay on the Beach ready
          for them, but it went to Greens Farms &amp; landed there. News soon come to Town and as
          they fird the Cannon to make an alarm, one poor fellow was so affrighted that he dropt
          down. </p>
        <p> Alarms almost every night, some of them false. With driving away our cattle &amp;
          carting- away furniture occupied us the rest part of the year. One morning- we saw 30
          ships off the Harbor.</p>
        <p>1780</p>
        <italic>
          <p>The winter of 1780 was much the severest that had occurred in 40 years, the Snow filled
            the roads from side to side, &amp; the air was pro- portionately keen. In one of the
            coldest nights of that dreary winter, 7 captives having got out of the Ship (one of
            them, Ebenezer Bartram, our neighbor, had his toes frozen) waited on the ice for about
            40 more. They not coming, they took to their heels, amidst a shower of bullets which
            were fird from the surrounding guardships, &amp; made for the land.</p>
          <p>When they arrived on Long Island they came to a house where they were dancing &amp;
            went in.</p>
          <p>A British officer present sent off for a guard to secure them &amp; placed himself at
            the door to obstruct their retreat, but their comrade, a huge Irishman, with one blow
            felled him to the floor.</p>
          <p>They then set off in the night once more, but the air was so extremely piercing, sad
            necessity obliged them to stop at another house where only an old man &amp; his wife
            occupied the fire. To this they made directly without ceremony. The inhabitants were
            shy, but when they got warm, the Americans told them they were going to New York.</p>
          <p> "No" said the old man, "I know who you are,—you are prisoners from the ship, but fear
            nothing. The officer you saw has gone for a guard, but cannot be back in two hours,—have
            something to eat."</p>
          <p> Having partook of some refreshment, he piloted them to a Stack where they staid till
            the search was over, and then retired to a Barn where the Old man fed them all next day,
            &amp; the succeeding night sent his son to show them where they could cross the Sound
            which they did, steering by the stars—</p>
          <p> They never could hear of their friend the Old man afterwards, whom it would have
            delighted them to reward.</p>
          <p> While in Prison, their allowance was scarce enough to keep body &amp; soul
            together—their bedclothing was so scant that onehalf had to walk in their shirts while
            the rest slept, &amp; those that were delicate perished. In those long &amp; dismal
            nights they were enveloped in total darkness, being allowed no candles.</p> (Related to
          me by T. Bartram,<!--Thomas Bartram--> brother of the Captain.)</italic> Jan.—A vast
        quantity of light snow fell &amp; a strong N.W. Wind blew it incessantly for 3 or 4 days
        thicker than a snow storm &amp; drifted so hard that sleds, loaded, came over the tops of
        the fences. The Harbor was froze so hard that loads of wood went on the Channel,
        <!--Question: what is the "channel" long island sound? --> the Ice being 1/2 foot thick.
        Capt. Parks cut out from the upper Wharf
        <!--Question: does this mean they had to cut shipt out from ice--> in 14 days. Ducks, Geese,
        &amp;c laid out on the land. Joseph Bartram came across the Sound at Whitestone after his
        escape from the old Jersey Prison Ship. <italic>(The name Joseph Bartram may be mistaken for
          Ebenezer, his brother; cf. following note and entry, 1781.)</italic>
        <p> March 18—Capt. Fry &amp; Lieut. Willard &amp; twenty soldiers went to Town,
          <!--question Which town? are they local fairfield people?--> having been here 46 days.
          (Garrison of the Fort.)</p>
        <p> March 27—I begun to study Latin Grammar with Mr. Eliot.
          <!--Same preacher mentioned above--> I began my studies &amp; so large a portion of the
          town consumed, the Cats &amp; Rats took to the houses that remained in great numbers. Our
          roaster put down his hand to stroke one of the rats, thinking him to be poor Horace, his
          favorite dog.</p>
        <p> When the town was burnt, some were for dismissing their Pastor that they could not pay
          him, but he courageously told them that he would continue with them even if they gave him
          nothing.</p> He was a fine scholar in the Latin tongue and a very social &amp; merry in
        company—his salary was 420 dollars per Annum. (This Year there was not any Rain from the
        19th of May till the 7th of August.) <p> April 21—Taking up a Crib, we kilid 50 Rats.</p>
        <p>May 19—Dark Day—Candles were lighted, &amp; fowls went to roost. The Darkness was greater
          to the Eastward &amp; less to the Westward. The Clouds appeared of a yellow colour like
          brass.</p>
        <p>July 16—Capt. Whitney's Vessel was carried off from Mill River &amp; himself murdered
          coming out of the Cabbin.</p>
        <p>Capt. (Nehemiah) Whitney at Mill River was sleeping unsuspiciously | in his Cabin.
          Hearing a noise on deck &amp; coming up, he was knocked ]i down &amp; killed. This, though
          a slight affair contributed to keep up , that continued state of fear &amp; alarm which
          lasted (excepting the hard winter) for several years. What increased the danger more was a
          number of Tones from every town who could pilot (and often did) the enemy into every place
          they pleased to come. ' </p>
        <p>Newtown was more particularly famous for these wretches,—the ' Whigs from Fairneld went
          &amp; took their fowls &amp; turkeys by force s (in a mob) &amp; brought them home.</p>
        <p>Greenfield Hill was a place among others where a Liberty Pole was set up &amp; the throng
          drank confusion to King George &amp; hurra for , Liberty!</p>
        <p> The Torries by night cut it down—The Whigs set it up again &amp; plated it with iron as
          high as they could reach, but the Tories with a ladder sawed it off above the plates.</p>
        <p> Aug. 17—Capt. (Caleb) Brewster returned from one of his customary cruises &amp; brought
          news that they had killed Gorham Smith of a party that attempted to take their Boats &amp;
          lost one of their own taken prisoner.</p>
        <p> About this time a large number of Privateers from 4 to 12 Guns of the Enemy's &amp; ours
          are cruising in the Sound &amp; take almost every unarmd Vessel that enters it—and when
          opportunity offers, plunder on both sides—</p>
        <!--this is from the class start here-->
        <p> It was customary for the enemy to come from L. Island in Whaleboats (sharp at each end
          and manned with 8 to 10 oars) These, under cover of night, might be drawn up into some
          unfrequented nook while the rascals plundered &amp; if pursued they could crawl off &amp;
          soon be out of gunshot. Sometimes they would bring British goods and among them a species
          of velvet called Corduroy, from which this was long called the Corduroy trade.</p>
        <p> Captain Caleb Brewster of Black Rock with 3 whale-boats about midway of the Sound
          against Fairneld, met 3 of the enemy's boats, when an engagement commenced. The boat that
          opposed Brewster had a small piece &amp; was leeward; there was a fresh gale &amp;
          Brewster reserving his fire till within 8 or 10 rods of Hoyt, poured in a broadside &amp;
          then another &amp; boarded; there was a large Irishman in the enemy's boat, who walked
          several times fore and aft, brandishing his broad- sword till Hasselton, a mighty fellow
          from the State of Massachusetts, snatched it from him &amp; cut his throat from ear to
          ear; he died immediately.</p>
        <p>Capt. Brewster being wounded was several times struck on the back with the steel rammer
          of a gun by Hoyfc On board of Hoyt's boat all hut one were killed or wounded. In
          Brewster's boat 4 were wounded— one (Judson Sturges) mortally.</p>
        <p>Another of our boats had a swivel (gun) which killed 2 men at one shot in another of the
          enemy's boats &amp; they immediately surrendered: the enemy's third boat escaped.</p>
        <p>Capt. Brewster was also at the capture of Thomas, who commanded a privateer of the enemy
          mounting 14 guns, &amp; manned with 35 men. Our vessel had about 70 men. The enemy hailed
          &amp; ordered them to bring to.</p>
        <p>"Aye, aye, presently."</p>
        <p> "Bring to, I say."</p>
        <p>"Aye, aye,"—and running their bowsprit across them about amid- ships, the sailing master,
          Hezekiah Gold exclaimed, "Strike, strike, damn you, or I'll sink you to hell!"</p>
        <p>Of the enemy 9 were killed &amp; 5 wounded, not one of ours was hurt; they were taken off
          Stratford-point &amp; carried into Black Rock; they had taken 2 row-boats bearing the
          Continental flag that morning &amp; had the men in their hold.</p>
        <p>Sept. 27—The Sun appeared like a Gold Ring.</p>
        <p>Oct. 29—2 Rainbows appeared in a Cloud &amp; those vanishing 2 more appeard.—</p>
