                  <h2>Old Black Rock</h2>
                  
                  <p>BLACK ROCK</p>
                  
                  <p>Seaport of Old Fairfield</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Fairfield owed much of its financial
                     and political prestige to an excellent seaport. The seaport of Fairfield was old Black
                     Rock.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>To-day Black Rock is merely a section of Bridgeport. Airplanes zoom overhead; real
                     estate booms underfoot; and we must sketch our historical picture against a background
                     of modern monuments.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Between the Orphan Asylum and the Socony filling station is the site of the Indian
                     fort. Near the automobile graveyard and the city dump stood the mills that anciently
                     ground out flour for the colonial countryside. Fire, careless remodeling, or neglect
                     have ruined many of the old houses. The one survival of sea- trade is a rough sign:
                     "Live lobsters for sale" — nailed, ironically enough, where the forgotten shipyard
                     once
                     launched a hundred ships, and where on the nearby wharves the rich cargoes of those
                     same
                     ships, returning, were welcomed by the busy pulleys and creaking windlasses of a dozen
                     stores and warehouses.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The flotsam and jetsam of historical incident have been scattered across three
                     centuries, yet we may still salvage stray anecdotes concerning the salty days when
                     every
                     house in the village was the home of a sea-captain.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Fortunately there lived in Black Rock for eighty-two years — from 1762 to 1845 — a
                     sympathetic historian. The record of harbor happenings during those bustling days
                     was
                     jotted down by William Wheeler briefly but delightfully, together with the pioneer
                     legends of his family, and sage comment upon political, social, and personal matters.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The Wheeler Journal, like history, is made up of the ridiculous as well as of the
                     sublime. However we may revere our ancestors, it is always reassuring to those who
                     in
                     our turn may become ancestors, to learn that these forbears of ours were human and
                     occasionally fallible — even as you and I. We should be grateful to William Wheeler,
                     therefore, not only for his vivid account of the capture of General Silliman and of
                     the
                     defense of Black Rock Fort in 1779, but for not slighting the record that on the 15th
                     of
                     November, 1787, "Capt. Brewster's wife &amp; child fell in the creek," that in 1807
                     three members of one family were "sick with bilious colic—rose from drinking cider
                     that
                     ran through a lead cock," as well as the sad tale of the young man who "after dancing,
                     waiting on a Female home, wet his foot &amp; not drying it before he left her, he was
                     taken ill and lived only 7 days."
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The history of Black Rock is thus made up of the heroic, the commonplace and the
                     humorous, — a history written between the lines of church and probate records, in
                     old
                     deeds, in long-lost logs of the merchant ships, and supplemented at moments by the
                     Wheeler Journal.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The pioneer story is a thrice-told tale, but we may give the incident new interest
                     by
                     recalling the geographical as well as the chronological positions of the original
                     settlements in the vicinity of Fairfield.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Fairfield, established by Roger Ludlowe in 1639, is most import- ant. Northeast lies
                     Stratfield (known in earliest days as Fayre- field Village and Fayreford). Fairfield
                     and
                     Stratfield were connected then as now, by a road long in use before being formally
                     laid
                     out in 1687 as King's Highway.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>East of Fairfield and south of Stratfield another settlement was made at the tip of
                     the
                     peninsula formed by two creeks and the Sound. This settlement became known as Black
                     Rock
                     village, — named from the black rocks along the shore, — and was for three generations
                     a
                     family holding.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Thomas Wheeler, the elder, came from Concord with a company of other pioneers in 1644.
                     His companions settled in Stratfield and in Greenlea, — as the section near Seaside
                     Park
                     in Bridgeport was then known. Thomas Wheeler separated from them and established his
                     home at the head of Black Rock harbor. Here he was a short distance across the waters
                     of
                     "shipharbour creeke" from his relatives and friends* at Greenlea, and not too far
                     from
                     Fairfield.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The first Wheeler homestead was surrounded on three sides water and stood on a rise
                     of
                     ground overlooking the level plain to the west. Thomas built his house of stone with
                     a
                     strong plank roof and upon this roof, to supplement the natural advantages of his
                     location, he placed two small cannon. One pointed out down the harbor against possible
                     Dutch invasion by sea: the other was directed toward the Indian fort that stood north
                     of
                     the little hill. The Indians were friendly and the Dutch were invisible, but Thomas
                     Wheeler was a cautious man.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>This Wheeler "homelot" at the "head of shipharbour" was the nucleus of Black Rock
                     village. The village was for many years inhabited by Thomas Wheeler's grandchildren
                     and
                     their children almost exclusively. There were enough of them, however, to occupy the
                     acres between the old homelot and Grover's Hill with their houses and pasturage, and
                     to
                     divide other lands with nonresident proprietors whose homesteads stood in Fairfield
                     or
                     Stratfield.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>From the Thomas Wheeler homestead a road led northwest, meeting the Fairfield road
                     at
                     the present intersection of Brewster Street and Fairfield Avenue. The old Fairfield
                     road, however, coincided with the modern Post Road only between Ash Creek and Ellsworth
                     Street. At the latter point (near the Indian fort) the old road turned northeast (along
                     the present line of North Ellsworth Street) to the upper creek. Here were two forks.
                     One
                     road led northwest across the upper creek to King's Highway and the Holland Heights
                     Road. The other fork led to the Indian Field and thence to Stratfield.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>*The earliest recorded settlers at Greenlea and Black Rock are: Ephraim Wheeler; Thomas
                     Wheeler; Thomas Wheeler, Jr.; William Odell; John
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Evarts; Joseph Middlebrook; James Bennet; Peter Johnson; and Benjamin Turney.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>For many years there was no direct route due east, and we moderns who are accustomed
                     to
                     speed along the Post Road must recall that there were only a few scattered farms between
                     Stratfield and Greenlea where Bridgeport now extends. Moreover, when roads were in
                     the
                     making, early surveyors followed a trail that avoided the old Indian fort. The cautious
                     pioneer always gave his Indian neighbors as much room as possible.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>This fort, garrisoned by two hundred Indians, had been palisaded against the tribes
                     of
                     the interior. North and east extended the Old Indian Field as it became known in early
                     deeds. All of this land was sold by the Indians to the town of Fairfield in 1681,
                     but
                     during the preceding thirty years there were probably many dramatic incidents in the
                     lives of the members of the Wheeler family.*
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The purchase of the Indian Field ended Indian occupation in Black Rock. The Indians
                     moved north and the new owners divided the field, as was customary, by a lottery.
                     This
                     method of apportionment satisfied contemporary landholders, but created many
                     difficulties for latterday historians and genealogists. A pioneer whose landholdings
                     were scattered from the Dan of SasquaNeck (Southport) to the Beersheba of Stratfield
                     and
                     who casually described his boundaries only by naming his neighbors provided many
                     complications. When a boundary "east on John Wheeler" may mean east on John's homelot,
                     on his Compo dividend, on his Long Lot, or on his share in the Indian Field, and when
                     the north, south and west boundaries are defined only by the names of others who,
                     like
                     John Wheeler, held widely distributed lands, it is difficult to reconstruct from the
                     land records an accurate picture of the holdings.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Another baffling custom was the designation of a lot by the name of the original owner,
                     even after several transfers, or the definition of a boundary by a landmark long since
                     forgotten. †
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>*In addition to uncertainties of Indian temperament, colonial peace of mind had other
                     menaces. During the witchcraft delusion, Goody Knap was hanged in 1651 at Try's Field
                     (northwest of the Indian Field in Black Rock — near the present site of the Burroughs
                     Home). † "Briant's Field" in Black Rock is mentioned a century after Alexander Bryant
                     terminated his few years of residence in Fairfield and moved to Milford. "Near old
                     Hoit's land," and "land over the creeke" (which might mean any one of the three creeks
                     on the Black Rock boundary) are exasperating examples.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Fortunately for the amateur topographer, there were few householders in Black Rock
                     until after 1750. John Wheeler, son of Thomas the pioneer, married first Judith Turney,
                     and second Elizabeth Rowland, succeeding to the Wheeler property in Black Rock and
                     adding more lands by purchase from non-resident dividend holders.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>John Wheeler had twelve children. Five of his sons settled in Black Rock. Another,
                     Thomas, sailed from the harbor one day early in 1696. Weeks later his elder brother,
                     John, received the following letter:
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Barbadoes, July 19, 1696 . . . . . . Loving brother John,</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>these lines may inform you that I am aboard of a man of war called Play now bound
                     for

                     cleared.

                  <p>I desire you to take care of three barrels of Rum which I have aboard of Nicklas
                     Inglesbee and I have three months wages down which is ten pounds ten shillings. The
                     sloop is called the Dimon. She belongs to Rhode Island, but bound to New London. I
                     have
                     no loading for it.

                     God who is our presence.

                  <p>Let us watch and pray one for another. No more at present but your loving brother,</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Thomas Wheeler.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>After eight years this pathetic message was admitted to probate in Fairfield as the
                     last will and testament of the writer. The methods by which the English navy recruited
                     men in early colonial days were already menacing homelife in the villages by the
                     Connecticut sea.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>For another glimpse of the early Wheeler families, we have the romantic story told
                     by
                     William Wheeler of the wedding of Hannah, younger sister of the unfortunate Thomas.
                     The
                     stem brother ("my grandfather") who flourished the horsewhip on this occasion was
                     the
                     same "loving brother John" to whom the  Barbadoes letter was
                     addressed. His responsibilities were many. His father, Sergeant John, after serving
                     the
                     town as representative for four terms, died in 1681, leaving twelve children, eight
                     of
                     them under age. John, the oldest son, assumed the family cares, and undeterred, —
                     or
                     perhaps fortified — by experience, married Abigail Burr, and reared thirteen children
                     of
                     his own. Of these, only three sons, Obediah, Jabez, and Ichabod,* continued the saga
                     of
                     the Wheeler family of Black Rock.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Other families came to share with the Wheelers the homesites by the harbor. The
                     colonial names of Squire, Burr, Penfield, Bartram, Wilson, Chauncy, Osborn, Jennings,
                     Silliman, Sherwood, and Sturges became prosperously identified with the port.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The sea which played so dramatic a role in the story of the earliest settlers in Black
                     Rock continued to influence the development of the village. The number of ships that
                     plied in and out of the harbor increased yearly.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>After 1730 trade impetus along Ash Creek brought results remarkable in those leisurely
                     days. In 1733 Peter Thorp and Ebenezer Dimon were given liberty to set a warehouse
                     at
                     the lower end of the creek. In 1750 Peter Penfield was authorized to establish his
                     mill
                     there, mills which were to continue for a century. In 1753 a new bridge was proposed
                     and
                     new roads planned to shorten the distance between Fairfield center and the ship
                     harbor.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>As the map shows, the early roads were almost as circuitous as their descriptions
                     in
                     the records. † The new thoroughfare was surveyed more directly, — almost due east
                     from
                     lower Benson Road, across an inlet by the Penfield mills, and along the shore of the
                     creek to the new bridge. The stone foundations of this road are still plainly visible,
                     as are the foundation piers of the bridge over which the road led to what is now
                     Balmforth Street in Black Rock, — the short road that curves over the shoulder of
                     Grovers Hill and joins Grovers Avenue now just as it did two hundred and seventy-five
                     years ago. Grovers Avenue had existed long before the building of the new road, but
                     merely as a farm road from the harbor to the hill pastures. There had originally been
                     a
                     field gate across it halfway between the turnpike and the Hill.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p class="footnote">There had been an elder, John, his father's favorite, who died in 1725.
                     Shortly after his death was born a step-brother, mournfully christened Ichabod ("Thy
                     glory is departed"). The most definite reads: "The highway on the east side of Uncaway
                     Creek which lyeth on the northwest side of the swamps that lie on the northward side
                     of
                     the main highway or common road going out of said road from the south and runneth
                     by and
                     between the land of the said Nathan Gold and said John Wheeler until on the northeast
                     or
                     east it falleth into the highway or road in front of the land called Cable's Field."
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The opening of the shorter route immediately affected the pasture lands along Grovers
                     Avenue. David Wheeler, 3rd, was first to profit thereby — and in a manner to interest
                     our modern realtors. Taking over from his father ten acres of meadow, the progressive
                     David deeded to the town two streets to lead from Grovers Avenue to the harbor, and
                     dividing the land into lots, he pointed their advantages to seafarers whose homes
                     lay
                     inconveniently far from shore. The first purchasers were Captain Joseph Silliman and
                     Captain Thomas Holburton, and both immediately built where their families might overlook
                     the Sound and sight their homing ships.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Next to buy was a company of thirteen prominent citizens of Fairfield who acquired
                     land
                     for a wharf at the end of one of David Wheeler's new roads. Adjacent lots were soon
                     sold
                     for homebuilding or investment and the first real estate development in Black Rock
                     proved successful.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Meanwhile David's cousin. Captain Ichabod Wheeler, had busied himself near the old
                     family homelot at the head of the harbor. He had been given liberty by the town in
                     1761
                     to build a new wharf there, but after embarking on the venture, decided that it might
                     be
                     more profitable to sell shares. He therefore reserved a one-sixth interest in the
                     wharf,
                     the timber, and the "well already Dugg"; and sold the other five-sixths to James
                     Smedley, Samuel Bradley, Jr., Ebenezer Bartram, Jr., Robert Wilson, and Nathaniel
                     Wilson. Captain Ichabod Wheeler was a shipbuilder and his son, the observant and
                     note-taking William, ^Is us that he built at the Upper Wharf six vessels, all above
                     ninety tons; one, sold to Thomas Alien of New London, who went bankrupt, occasioned
                     a
                     loss of two hundred and sixty-five pounds ¬ — to the builder. With the others he was
                     more fortunate.

                  <p>The list of investors in the wharves and warehouses of Black Rock about this time
                     includes all of the merchant-residents of Fairfield. Three wharves were built, including
                     the upper wharf, near the old shipyard. The Middle Wharf, already mentioned, lay midway
                     between these and the wharf projected by Captain Samuel Squire at “Money Beach”. Each
                     of
                     these wharves had its store or warehouse, with sheds, chandlery, and tackle for
                     unloading and loading. If we scan probate inventories for the pre-Revolutionary years,
                     we shall find many entries indicating invested wealth on the high seas and alongshore
                     —
                     shares in sailing ships, and in cargoes held by merchants and sailors whose names
                     are a
                     roster of the contemporary Chamber of Commerce in Fairfield. *

                  <p class="footnote">Transfers of proprietorship are recorded so often that any list is
                     incomplete. We note, however, in addition to those mentioned as proprietors of the
                     Upper
                     Wharf, these others who kept in close touch with the seatrade: Col. Abraham Gold and
                     his
                     brother Captain Abel, Moses Jennings, Jonathan Lewis, Captain Job Bartram and his
                     brother Barnabas, Hezekiah Sturges, Gershom Burr, Thaddeus Burr, Hezekiah Fitch, Dr.

                     the
                     three Sturges brothers, Captain Barlow, Captain Benjamin, and Captain Gershom, — and
                     later Peter Perry of Mill Plain, John S. Wilson, Amos Wilson, Isaac Marquand, and
                     William and Rufus Hoyt. There were many others — cf. indices.

                  <p>Therefore these wharves became stormcenters with the oncoming of the Revolution. Angry
                     groups gathered as each ship arrived with fresh and newly disquieting reports,
                     supplemented by news brought by post riders galloping down from King’s Highway.

                  <p>The closing of Boston harbor directly affected the livelihood of every seaman.
                     Stagnation at Boston Wharves threatened starvation at the wharves of Black Rock. The
                     old
                     taverns rang with violent discussion. Men high in the colony councils, — Thaddeus
                     Burr,
                     Captain Samuel Squire, Gold Selleck Silliman, — were eagerly besought for authoritative
                     information. Their personal interests hung largely in the balance, as landholders
                     and
                     wharfowners; but their patriotism turned from King to Colony, and the town records
                     indicate the result of their influence in Fairfield.

                  <p>The year after Isaac Jarvis and young Joseph Squire marched from Black Rock to
                     Lexington, the Connecticut coast was fortified and the commissioning of privateersmen

                  <p>Fairfield maintained a nightly coast-patrol. In addition, a fort was erected on Grovers
                     Hill to command the mouth of the harbor and protect the shipping as well as to guard
                     the
                     Penfield mills and bakehouse on Ash Creek, which were supplying bread to the new

                     night
                     in 1779 when the twelve-pounders shattered the stillness, rattled the village windows,
                     and awoke the sleeping townsfolk who rushed out to learn that General Silliman had
                     been
                     captured at his house on Holland Heights. His captors, landing stealthily at the head
                     of
                     the harbor, had been guided up the turnpike, and had successfully made their way back
                     with the captive general and his son. The party was safely across the break in the

                  <p>William Wheeler implies that his cousin and neighbor, Ezra Wheeler, could have told
                     who
                     guided the British: but since Ezra's name later appears as a member of the battery
                     guard
                     it is probable that if the rumor had any foundation, it is in the fact that Ezra's
                     brothers, Josiah and Abraham Wheeler, were recognized Tories and later had their
                     property confiscated on that account. We do not always love our neighbors, especially
                     in
                     war-time. Moreover entries in the Wheeler Journal are influenced by the age and the
                     emotions of the journalist at the time of writing. The testimony of a seventeen-year-old
                     must be read as such, and not as the judicial report of an unprejudiced adult.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>However we may discount young William Wheeler's casual observations, we must credit
                     him
                     fully with his colorful description of the events of that foggy July morning when
                     the
                     British anchored off the fort. Young William had gone with his father to drive cattle
                     up
                     to safer Toilsome Hill pasturage. He hurried back to find everyone watching from the
                     summit of Grovers Hill above the fort the manoeuvres of the invading parties. The
                     boat-
                     loads at Kenzie's Point were well out of range, but the British soldiers rowing in
                     to
                     the mill-wharves at the mouth of the creek were raked by shot from the fort as the
                     fog
                     lifted. So hotly was the harbor defended that after burning the mills and bakehouse,
                     as
                     well as the Penfield homestead that stood back of them on Paul's Neck, the British
                     came
                     no nearer to Black Rock that day, but continued their destructive march north.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The next morning while Fairfield town was in flames, an attack was launched against
                     the
                     fort. Failing, the invaders sailed away, leaving the houses and shipping at the harbor
                     secure.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The historian will note that the Wheeler Journal fails to mention the greater battles
                     and manoeuvres of the Revolution. Only local skirmishes are chronicled. This makes
                     the
                     Journal intensely human. We see the Revolution entirely through the eyes of a boy
                     in a
                     Connecticut village by the Sound. Military matters (except for the fort and the two
                     British invasions) are subordinated wholly to obscure naval encounters. William
                     Wheeler’s perspective is limited to events within his own hearing or vision.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>George Washington’s Revolution was very different from William Wheeler’s Revolution,
                     —and perhaps not much more important; for the struggle was not only between the armies
                     in the text-books. The result was determined on a dozen frontiers by land and sea.
                     The
                     whaleboats of Caleb Brewster, the forays to Long Island, the Tory guerilla warfare,
                     described in the Journal, —all weighed heavily in the final balance. The history of
                     Black Rock epitomizes the tale told by a hundred other seaports, — of a rebellion
                     successful because it was whole-souled. George Washington’s army was fed on bread
                     from
                     Fairfield mills and those of a dozen other patriotic towns, while British supplies
                     were
                     intercepted by a hundred impudent little privateers. Black Rock harbor was a detail
                     of
                     the heroic background of Yorktown.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>After the Revolution, changes came to Black Rock, as prosperity increased. Several
                     families, burned out by the British invasion of Fairfield, rebuilt near the shore,
                     and
                     young men like Caleb Brewster, whose domestic plans had been postponed during their
                     patriotic activities, married and settled down by the wharves.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The bustle along the harbor continued as ship after ship came into port, bringing
                     molasses and rum from the West Indies, tea from China, and news from everywhere. Other
                     smaller craft voyaged along the coast, putting in occasionally for supplies and trading.
                     Boys of Black Rock, with or without family sanction, slipped frequently aboard and
                     served a hard but joyful apprenticeship at sea. In 1819, of less than one hundred
                     inhabitants of the village, men, women, and children, it is recorded that twenty-eight
                     men were gone as sailors, one-half of them captains.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Down by the shore, next to the old Middle Wharf, stood a tiny house, occupied by
                     Wolcott Chauncey, his wife, and their nine children. Three of the boys who splashed
                     about the piers of the old wharf were to account heroically for themselves in
                     history.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Isaac Chauncey, born in Black Rock in 1772, went to sea at thirteen, and when nineteen
                     was given command of his first ship. He rose in rank rapidly, served in the navy as
                     Captain during the war with Tripoli, afterward commanding the Brooklyn Navy Yard in
                     peace time and the Great Lakes from 1812 to 1816. He was awarded a sword for gallantry
                     in action and is one of the heroes buried in the National Cemetery at Arlington. His
                     brothers, Captain Ichabod Wolcot Chauncey and Robert Chauncey, also served loyally
                     in
                     the Navy during the early years of the republic.

                  <p>As it was during the Revolution our national history thereafter is curiously epitomized
                     in the life of this little village by the sea.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Our first three wars were all directly caused by events which affected seafaring
                     Americans and shipping interests on the Atlantic coast.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The Port Bill and the closing of Boston Harbor forced the issue in 1774.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Our second war — with Tripoli — was the outcome of such tales as that told by the
                     six
                     prisoners in 1795 in the Wheeler Journal.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Our third war — in 1812 — resulted from British impressment of able-bodied seamen,
                     continuous since the days of young Thomas Wheeler, and confirmed by anecdotes such
                     as
                     the Journal entry in 1806 that:
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>"At this time came 2 letters from Mr. Francis Forgue, now on board of a man-of-war
                     in
                     the English Channel — he had not been heard of in 15 years."
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The war of 1812, however, began with no such popular heroics as those of 1774-5.
                     Ship-owners and merchants who had endured loss until the fighting word was given at
                     Lexington, murmured over war conditions in 1812. The intervening years of prosperity
                     had
                     softened their lives, while party dissension had affected their economic views. Was
                     the
                     new war with England patriotic or political?
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>All this is reflected in the Journal of the boy, grown forty years older and wiser.
                     There is no enthusiasm in William Wheeler's d gf 1812-14, — only such sober items
                     as:
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>"Four vessels, nearly 100 tons each, lie nose by nose in Brewster's Cove &amp; four
                     more at the wharves, useless by reason of the war . . . . This foolish &amp; unnecessary
                     War goes much against us — Gen. William Hull taken &amp; this week news of 400 killed
                     &amp; 800 wounded on Lake Erie by the British &amp; Indians" . . . . 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Even the glorious exploits of his erstwhile neighbor, Isaac Chauncy. Commander of
                     the
                     Great Lakes, escape mention: and it is about this time that the manuscript essays
                     begin
                     to show the pacifistic trends of thought which continued throughout the rest of William
                     Wheeler's life.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>One threatened invasion by two British frigates alarmed Black Rock, and on the 29th
                     of
                     August, 1814, Thomas Bartram deeded to Walter Thorp, Sullivan Moulton, Gershom Sturges,
                     Abraham Benson, James Knap, Abraham G. Jennings and Nathaniel L. Green, one acre of
                     land
                     on Grovers Hill
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p class="smaller">"with liberty to pass &amp; repass . . . . and said land is expressly
                     sold for the purpose of defense against an enemy, either in fortification or otherwise
                     &amp; the land is ever to be held for that use in time of war."
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The silver cloud of peace was darkly lined, however. West India produce dropped to
                     half-price. There was a trade reaction after the war from which small shipping never
                     entirely recovered.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Moreover, as Newfield (now Bridgeport) harbor on the east developed in rivalry with
                     the
                     old port of Fairfield, there was justice in Timothy Dwight's observation in 1822
                     that:
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p class="smaller">“Notwithstanding the excellence of the harbor and the convenience which
                     it furnishes for commerce. Black Rock has long been neglected."
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>He adds:</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>“Business is now commencing . . with a fair promise of success."</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The promise was never fulfilled. Presently ships that always had sailed from Black
                     Rock
                     wharves, cleared from Bridgeport. Black Rock sea-captains were promoted to larger
                     vessels that docked at New York, Boston, Providence, and Baltimore. 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Sporadic industrial and business ventures mark the history of Black Rock during the
                     rest of the century, — the old shipyard continued to serve sloops and schooners: a
                     wagon
                     shop and a cooperage were maintained for several years. The wharves still were used.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Manufacturing developments swung Bridgeport into ever- increasing prosperity, however,
                     and swept prosperity from Fairfield harbor. When in 1870 an act of legislature extended
                     the Bridgeport boundary to Ash Creek, only a few protesting voices were raised in
                     Fairfield town meeting.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Upon the old lot where once Thomas Wheeler settled, a turpentine factory reared its
                     tall chimney. Near the site of the old fort on Grovers Hill, a summer hotel was built.
                     These in their turn have passed. Grovers Hill is a "residential development," and
                     the
                     upper wharves are soon to be included in the plans for a new boulevard that will connect
                     Bridgeport with Black Rock across Fayerweather Island.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Black Rock is no longer a quiet village, no longer a seaport, — it is merely a
                     "district," — and with the coming of the boulevard, the sentimental historian will
                     be
                     honked at sharply or advised to park elsewhere. Meanwhile we have a few leisurely
                     moments to share the historic past with William Wheeler.

                  <p>Had William Wheeler been born in eighteenth-century London and exposed to the literary
                     vicissitudes and stimuli of the period, he might have become another Goldsmith. His
                     career, postponed a century and a half, might have been that of a Walter Winchell
                     or a
                     Franklin P. Adams.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Accepting him as he actually found himself, among the surroundings which he was to
                     chronicle, we discover him as a delightful diarist, noting from his boyhood the events
                     of village life, and later summing up his meditations in a series of amusing essays,
                     and
                     leaving a journal historically and humanistically invaluable.

                  <p>He was born July 12th, 1762, the second child and elder son of Ichabod and Deborah
                     (Burr) Wheeler. Captain Ichabod Wheeler was a builder of ships at the old Upper Wharf
                     in
                     Black Rock: But like most of his neighbors, experienced in the vagaries of an income
                     wrested from the sea, he depended for the support of his family upon the farming of
                     his
                     inherited acres. Upon his farmlands young William toiled, early and late, and the
                     essay
                     upon Agriculture which he wrote in after years is no amateurish dissertation, but
                     a
                     practical treatise.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>IN 1780, William began to tutor for entrance to college, and from 1781 to 1785 he
                     attended Yale, observant and critical. His comment upon the ultimate value of his
                     college training is terse and strangely prophetic of modem educational heresies.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>His school-teaching venture in Norfield (now Weston) was punctuated by a poignant
                     love
                     affair with an unknown damsel (the asterisks are his own). Thereafter he returned
                     to
                     Black Rock and in 1800 married Rhoda Parrit (or Parrott). The rest of his days were
                     spent in his simple "saltbox" next his father's old house.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The death of his wife in 1808 left him with two small children, William, who was to
                     survive him, and a daughter, Eliza, whose death was to leave her father heartbroken.
                     His
                     frequent references to "E." as his companion on countryside rambles, and entries made
                     in
                     her handwriting in his journals, show the close companionship between father and
                     daughter and his appreciation of her literary ability. His tribute to her (June 15,1839)
                     is masterly in its terse sincerity. He lived until the 28th of January, 1845, continuing
                     to enter notes in the Journal within two months of his death, although the last entry
                     in
                     his handwriting (October 4th) shows that his mind was weakened by age and illness.
                     The
                     preceding year — 1843— when he was eighty-one years old he records that he "filled
                     my
                     barn with hay both sides . . . . labour'd every day myself (per favour) . ." Until
                     the
                     last he continued to interest himself in local and national events.

                  <p>William Wheeler left as memorials eleven volumes in manuscript which narrowly escaped
                     destruction during a ruthless New England housecleaning, but were rescued by Elizabeth
                     H. Schenck. She quoted liberally from his writings in her "History of Fairfield,"
                     and
                     gave the books to the Connecticut State Library at Hartford, where they are available
                     to
                     the persistent antiquarian who seeks original sources.

                  <p>There is something of Thoreau in William Wheeler's intense concentration upon everyday
                     happenings, and his application of small philosophies to a large plan of existence.
                     His
                     sense of proportion is, however, more rational than that of the sage of Walden.

                  <p>1630-1772 [The first page includes genealogical notes on the Wheeler

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The first Wheeler that came into America settled in Concord (Massachusetts) about
                     the
                     year 1630. He had several sons &amp; one of them came to Black Rock and at the old Lot
                     built a stone house with a flat roof of Plank on which he mounted two four-pounders,—one
                     pointed towards the Mouth of the Harbor &amp; the other at an Indian fort situated at
                     the head of the harbor, now known by the name of Old Fort.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>This place the Fairfield Indians had built for their defence against some of the
                     interior tribes with whom they were perpetually at War. It was composed of Palisades
                     joined together &amp; at each corner a room was built out with portholes like the
                     following figure: 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>It contained about an acre of land &amp; was garrisoned by about 200 Indians fond of
                     War &amp; often solliciting the Old Indian for leave to destroy the English. Once they
                     obtained it on condition of pulling up a large neighboring White Oak Tree-
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Well, to work they went &amp; stript off its branches, but still the trunk baffled
                     their utmost endeavours.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>"Thus" says the Old Sachem , "will be the end of your War—you may kill some of their
                     papooses, but the old plaguey Stump t'other side of the great Waters will remain &amp;
                     send out more branches—" 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>It happened one time that 6 of the Mohawk tribe, being closely pursued by the Fairfield
                     Indians were secreted by one of the Waklins of Stratfield under some sheaves of Flax,
                     &amp; being directed homewards, were the occasion of the long Amity that subsisted
                     between that tribe and the English.—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Many remains of the Indians are daily discovered, as Stone arrows, hatchets, etc.

                     made, holding about half a pint, at Black Rock some years since. A great part of their
                     food seems to have been Oysters, Clams &amp;c. by the vast beds of Shells that are

                  <p>My Grandfather had (I learn from tradition, there being no journals left of those
                     times) many brothers &amp; sisters, 14 in all.

                  <p>Hannah, the youngest, was a very intelligent person— about 18 years of age. She was
                     courted &amp; expected to be married to Ringfield a Captain of a ship who gave her a
                     gold ring, 3 pair of green silk stockings &amp;c, but he being gone for so long, she was
                     courted &amp; married by Sam Wheeler.

                  <p>On the day of their marriage, a Ship appearing taken for Ringfield by the Bride, she
                     burst into tears &amp; declared she would not be married, &amp; half dressed hid in a
                     hole in the back kitchen of my grandfather who, with horsewhip in hand, dragged her
                     out,
                     but she ran around him as he attempted to strike.—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>They finally concluded to dispatch a boat to see who commanded said ship. Finding
                     it
                     was not Ringfield (who was lost) she was married, but never could the Capt. be erased
                     from her mind, as (I am told by a person who was eye wit- ness) she used frequently
                     at
                     75 years of age to weep over his presents.

                  <p>A snow fell about the middle of December which filled the roads &amp; buried a pair of
                     Oxen at the old fort, owned by Sam Gold. They were found by their breathing holes.
                     The
                     harbour continued frozen from that time till the middle of May— Capt. Bostwick &amp;
                     Capt. Dimon were loading for the West Indies. Dimon said as winter set in. Bostwick
                     was
                     ready, but delaying one night, was froze in &amp; had to cart hay to his stock for 3
                     months. When going out of the Sound, he found Dimon returning.

                  <p>(From sketch of Mrs. Jonathan Wheeler.) She was remarkable for storytelling. In her
                     father's days she said the Sound was froze over and her father went half way to Long
                     Island when it began to break up. He being an active man, sprang from one cake to
                     another till he got ashore. It used to be so cold as to freeze cattle's mouths up
                     &amp;
                     they would have to get a teakettle of hot water to thaw them out. It used in winter
                     time
                     to freeze people's voices, and in the Spring when a thaw came there would be all kinds
                     of noises heard in the air.

                  <p>Sept. 2—In the evening 2 black clouds appeared in the South- West &amp; North-West,
                     &amp; one seemed to come &amp; meet them directly over Fairfield from the North East—at
                     half past Eight it began to thunder incessantly. The flashes of Lightning, which seemed
                     to set the room in a blaze, were about a minute's distance from each other, accompanied
                     with bursts of Thunder like the whole broadside of a Ship, making the Earth to tremble
                     and at the same time lifting one of our family from the seat at the side of the house
                     onto her feet. At the same time the room was filled with a sulphurous smell. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>(Struck Abel Wheeler's house twice and his signpost once— It was a tavern where much
                     vice was seen) Abel Wheeler got up, it struck him down; then they all stood up &amp;
                     were struck down—The Lightning ran in streams all through the Rooms, broke all the
                     lower
                     windows, but hurt none of the people.

                  <p>Down rushed the Rain, impetuous as if the floodgates of heaven had been opened.</p>
                  
                  <p>Many thought it was the World's last Session &amp; trembling sat, expecting every
                     Breath to be the last for 3 long hours; but at 1/2 past 11 it ceased.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>They all agree that the Storm tonight has been the hardest one that e'er this Land
                     has
                     seen. It must as nigh as we could guess Strike 90 times about this Place. A Barn was
                     struck &amp; burnt in Town.

                     North Fairfield to Danbury, stayd there one night, destroyed the Stores of Provision.
                     Our people collected &amp; Gen. Arnold built a breastwork in Ridgefield &amp; with 250
                     men stopt the whole army for 15 minutes. On our side lost Col. Gould &amp; a
                     considerable number more were killed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I perfectly remember the expedition of the enemy to Danbury (1777) &amp; was at work in
                     my father's garden when our people met them at Ridgefield where a temporary breastwork
                     was thrown up of rails &amp; behind which 250 patriots were posted under the command of
                     Gen. Arnold who sustained the fire of the whole British army (2200 picked men) for
                     15
                     minutes till the flank guards came round the corner of the house that stood by the
                     side
                     of the road where they were engaged—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Arnold, mounted on a horse, rode up to the breastwork and encouraged our men to fight
                     until his horse was shot dead under him—the soldier that shot the horse running to
                     take
                     Arnold, he while dropping, snatched his pistol from the holster and brought him to
                     the
                     ground with "Damn you, take that!"
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>My wife had a greatuncle (David Patchin) an experienced marksman at shooting pigeons
                     every fall, who was used to such sport as this, having been in the old French war,—when
                     under Abercrombie. His righthand man (as he has often told me) was shot down twice
                     in
                     one day &amp; then he had seven shots when he took as he said as good sight as ever he
                     did at pigeons,—the last time at one that came round the comer of the house about
                     3 rods
                     distance. He saw him drop, &amp; then, under cover of the smoke of the whole volley
                     which the British poured in upon them, retreated, &amp; when that left him, skulked
                     behind a rock where the balls struck spat! spat! spat! in the manner of hail; but
                     soon
                     under cover of more smoke, he came off safely ...
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The place where they retreated was a cleared spot through an orchard,—no cover—&amp;
                     there Col. Gould of Fairfield was shot &amp; was buried next day with the honors of war,
                     three volleys being fired over his grave ... (He married my mother's sister.)
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The firing was distinctly heard at Black Rock from Ridgefield and caused many
                     melancholy sensations—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Gen. Wooster endeavored to attack them in their rear, but his men would not come on,
                     &amp; there he was killed, being near 70 years of age.

                  <p>April 25—A boat load with 8 or 10 men landed against Old Fort at the head of Black
                     Rock
                     harbor in the night &amp; marched up to Gen. Silliman's &amp; took him &amp; his son
                     William through the broken place in the beach to Long Island, then in possession of
                     the
                     enemy. They were piloted by one of our own (Tories). As they passed over the beach,
                     the
                     old 12 pounders at the battery three times distinctly in a calm night made the windows
                     of my chamber shake. We were soon out, expecting the next moment to be a prisoner,
                     but
                     sending to the battery we learned the cause. The next morning the tracks of 8 men
                     were
                     discernible; 2 traced to the house of Ezra Wheeler, the next neighbor, who was tried
                     for
                     life before Putnam (then cantoned at a wood in Redding for the convenience of fuel
                     in
                     winter)—he was liberated.

                  <p>July 7—At 7 in the morning, the fog clearing off, the enemy's fleet, just returned
                     from
                     plundering New Haven, appeared. Three guns announced an alarm—everyone busy in moving
                     or
                     throwing their things out of doors. About 11 o'clock 1,600 regular troops landed at
                     the
                     foot of the bar on town beach. Isaac Jarvis commanded the battery at the point of
                     Grover's Hill, Black Rock, who, as soon as the British turned to go up the beach lane,
                     fired a 12-pounder with ball &amp; grape- shot, &amp; kept it going till it was so hot
                     you could hardly bear your hand thereon.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As they approached the parade, a field piece let go a ball &amp; grapes through
                     them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I was at that time on Toilsome Hill, having been just above with my father to drive
                     cattle to our woodland, to keep them from the enemy. As we arrived at Black Rock,
                     it was
                     with no pleasant sensation we heard the firing back towards Barlow's-plain, &amp; seemed
                     to be in danger of being hemmed in—this, however, we prevented by taking the upper
                     bridge.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Black Rock people soon assembled on Grover's hill, among whom were several females,
                     where we could see the enemy marching up. A continual cracking from near Round-hill
                     was
                     kept up the remainder of the afternoon &amp; sometimes from a field-piece.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The first building that appeared on fire was the guard-house at Kenzy's point; next
                     one
                     at Barlow's plain. You might from Black Rock see the fire shine through the windows
                     &amp; presently the fire on the outside. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>At night the British placed guards round the town which were plainly seen by the
                     burning houses,—while many a column of Fire from the flaming buildings &amp; frequent
                     flashes of Lightning from a western cloud with dis- charges of cannon &amp; musquetry
                     formed a Prospect the most Gloomy &amp; comfortless imaginable to the poor inhabitants
                     who, many of them sheltered only by the Canopy of Heaven, without a second Suit to
                     their
                     backs, or a Penny in their Purse, beholding from a Distance the fruit of all their
                     toil
                     &amp; labor expiring in a Cloud of smoke &amp; cinders.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>April 25—Ezra Wheeler's brothers Josiah and Abraham, as Tones, had their estates
                     confiscated subsequently, but Ezra Wheeler remained in Black Rock and served as a
                     member
                     of the battery guard in 1779.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The town burnt all night—a cloud seemed to remain fixed in the west, from which issued
                     frequent flashes of lightning; this, joined to many a column from the flaming buildings
                     &amp; frequent discharges of cannon &amp; musketry on the British guard placed around
                     the town; the poor inhabitants, with no shelter, with no clothing but what they had
                     on;
                     wives separated from their husbands &amp; exposed to the indecencies of an infuriated
                     soldiery, rendered truly diabolical by the spirits they found in plenty in the
                     town,—formed a scene altogether so shocking that Fairneld will never see again, nor
                     her
                     present silken sons &amp; daughters can form any conception of.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>There were some instances of great bravery among the inhabitants of Fairfield. A Mr.
                     Tucker fired from his shop on the parade at the whole army only a few rods distant,
                     &amp; was wounded by them in the shoulder &amp; taken prisoner. Mr. Parsons fired from a
                     chamber into the road &amp; killed a British officer; then running out the back door
                     made his escape. The enemy coming into the house, found an old negro bed-ridden; they
                     said it was him, he declared it was not; they put the bayonet into him &amp; burnt the
                     house, next day my brother saw him about half burnt up &amp; a beam lying on him.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Parsons, after this taking a prisoner, was conducting him away when he was taken
                     prisoner himself.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Joseph Gold, a very old man &amp; feeble, going off, stopped at a spring to drink; they
                     commanded him to stop; he would not; they shot him.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Several women stayed in town to save their houses; but were so frighted, they said
                     they
                     would never again stay.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Jonathan Bulkley, living on the Green, stayed, got a protection from General Tryon
                     &amp; saved his house &amp; three adjoining houses.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>July 8—A Row-Galley, mounting an 18-pounder of brass, lay 5 of a mile from the Battery,
                     &amp; fired upon it, sending some shot over the hill; &amp; the Battery firing on them,
                     &amp; hallooing with a speaking trumpet to turn their broadside towards them &amp; they
                     would give it to them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Isaac Jarvis commanded at the Battery. Had he been a coward, 10 more houses would

                  <p>About noon the enemy returned on board at Kenzy's Point, &amp; were pursued through the
                     burning houses by enraged inhabitants, and at Sandy Lane the roar of the small arms
                     was
                     continued like the roll of a drum.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Our people would have paid them as they were embarking, had they not levelled all
                     the
                     stone walls near the shore where our men might get behind, &amp; drew up their armed
                     vessels to keep off the Americans.

                  <p>It is said the Fairneld people fought much better than they did at New Haven or
                     Norwalk, which was burnt soon after.

                  <p>When the British burned FairEeld this map was made for or by Lieutenant Lawru of the
                     invading army,—hence the military accuracy of the details of gunrange and position
                     of
                     troops,—and hence also the many inaccuracies in the topography of the
                     hinterland—unfamiliar, of course to a British observer. "This manuscript map is

                  <p>About 40 of the enemy were found dead &amp; 8 or 10 of ours. No doubt many were wounded
                     &amp; carried off with them, for about a fortnight after, when on guard at the point,
                     I
                     observed the remains of one washed out of the sand where they had buried him.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Eighty dwelling-houses, besides barns, stores, etc. were consumed. A Presbyterian
                     meeting-house, Episcopalian Church &amp; a Court-house, Green's Farms with their
                     meeting-house, &amp; Mill River (Village) were burnt at the same time.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Eleven houses were left standing, some of them extinguished by our people who followed
                     close at the heels of the English, &amp; afforded a refuge to the poor inhabitants from
                     a hard succeeding winter, the most terrible but one (1740) ever seen since the
                     settlement of New England.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The severe cold quieted in some measure our fears from an attack, &amp; made the enemy
                     in New York tremble in their turn for fear our men should march on the ice &amp; attack
                     them—&amp; affording us a long season of excellent sleighing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Thus graciously did a kind Providence favour &amp; defend us from an unrelenting foe,
                     till they were tired out by the contest.

                  <p>The Sabbath after, Mr. Eliot preached (from 'Our holy &amp; our beauti- ful house,
                     where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things
                     are
                     laid waste') at Holland Hill* (William Wheeler's recollection seems
                     here at variance with the Parish register held states that the church service of July
                     11th after the burning of Fairfield was held at the house Deacon Bulkley—which was
                     one
                     of the few houses near the Green left standing. Services on subsequent Sundays were
                     held at Deodate Silliman's and other houses.) where Fairfield people assembled,
                     not daring to meet near the shore for fear of being taken prisoners, so fearful were
                     they—&amp; long after, they could hardly sleep in their beds.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>My father had a place for his silver tankard &amp; some silver therein, in a stonewall.
                     Many a time he has gone in a dark night with his gun to see if no enemy's boat came
                     over
                     the beach. (July 8 -The silver tankard, hidden by Captain Ichabod
                     Wheeler, is now in the collection Historical Society in Fairfield.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Sometimes very few guards at the Battery or anywhere else. Strange that the enemy
                     did
                     not burn us in the four long years that the war lasted after this time. I listed as
                     a
                     soldier in the Guard (Upper Wharf) from May 16th till July 7th, when Fairfield was
                     burnt, being 16 years of age. We had a double fortified 3 pounder, which sent a shot
                     over a boat of the enemy's, sounding at the broken place of the beach."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>About a fortnight after the Fire, I was drafted to go upon Guard a fortnight in town.
                     We kept Guard upon the Beach &amp; Kinsey's point,—3 sentrys at each place. One night
                     as
                     we were on Guard, we heard a Boat row, &amp; ran to the Shore &amp; lay on the Beach
                     ready for them, but it went to Greens Farms &amp; landed there. News soon come to Town
                     and as they fird the Cannon to make an alarm, one poor fellow was so affrighted that
                     he
                     dropt down. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Alarms almost every night, some of them false. With driving away our cattle &amp;
                     carting- away furniture occupied us the rest part of the year. One morning- we saw
                     30
                     ships off the Harbor.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>1780</p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The winter of 1780 was much the severest that had occurred in 40 years, the Snow filled
                     the roads from side to side, &amp; the air was pro- portionately keen. In one of the
                     coldest nights of that dreary winter, 7 captives having got out of the Ship (one of
                     them, Ebenezer Bartram, our neighbor, had his toes frozen) waited on the ice for about
                     40 more. They not coming, they took to their heels, amidst a shower of bullets which
                     were fird from the surrounding guardships, &amp; made for the land.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>When they arrived on Long Island they came to a house where they were dancing &amp;
                     went in.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>A British officer present sent off for a guard to secure them &amp; placed himself at
                     the door to obstruct their retreat, but their comrade, a huge Irishman, with one blow
                     felled him to the floor.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>They then set off in the night once more, but the air was so extremely piercing, sad
                     necessity obliged them to stop at another house where only an old man &amp; his wife
                     occupied the fire. To this they made directly without ceremony. The inhabitants were
                     shy, but when they got warm, the Americans told them they were going to New York.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>"No" said the old man, "I know who you are,—you are prisoners from the ship, but fear
                     nothing. The officer you saw has gone for a guard, but cannot be back in two hours,—have
                     something to eat."
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Having partook of some refreshment, he piloted them to a Stack where they staid till
                     the search was over, and then retired to a Barn where the Old man fed them all next
                     day,
                     &amp; the succeeding night sent his son to show them where they could cross the Sound
                     which they did, steering by the stars—
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>They never could hear of their friend the Old man afterwards, whom it would have
                     delighted them to reward.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>While in Prison, their allowance was scarce enough to keep body &amp; soul
                     together—their bedclothing was so scant that onehalf had to walk in their shirts while
                     the rest slept, &amp; those that were delicate perished. In those long &amp; dismal
                     nights they were enveloped in total darkness, being allowed no candles.

                  <p>Jan.—A vast quantity of light snow fell &amp; a strong N.W. Wind blew it incessantly
                     for 3 or 4 days thicker than a snow storm &amp; drifted so hard that sleds, loaded, came
                     over the tops of the fences. The Harbor was froze so hard that loads of wood went
                     on the
                     Channel,  the Ice being 1/2
                     foot thick. Capt. Parks cut out from the upper Wharf
                      in 14 days. Ducks,
                     Geese, &amp;c laid out on the land. Joseph Bartram came across the Sound at Whitestone
                     after his escape from the old Jersey Prison Ship. (The name Joseph
                     Bartram may be mistaken for Ebenezer, his brother; cf. following note and entry,
                     1781.)

                  <p>March 18—Capt. Fry &amp; Lieut. Willard &amp; twenty soldiers went to Town,
                      having been here 46 days.

                  <p>March 27—I begun to study Latin Grammar with Mr. Eliot.
                      I began my studies &amp; so large a portion of the
                     town consumed, the Cats &amp; Rats took to the houses that remained in great numbers.
                     Our roaster put down his hand to stroke one of the rats, thinking him to be poor Horace,
                     his favorite dog.

                     him nothing.

                     salary was 420 dollars per Annum. (This Year there was not any Rain from the 19th
                     of May

                     greater to the Eastward &amp; less to the Westward. The Clouds appeared of a yellow

                     Hearing a noise on deck &amp; coming up, he was knocked ]i down &amp; killed. This,
                     though a slight affair contributed to keep up , that continued state of fear &amp; alarm
                     which lasted (excepting the hard winter) for several years. What increased the danger
                     more was a number of Tones from every town who could pilot (and often did) the enemy
                     into every place they pleased to come. '

                  <p>The Torries by night cut it down—The Whigs set it up again &amp; plated it with iron as
                     high as they could reach, but the Tories with a ladder sawed it off above the
                     plates.

                  <p>Aug. 17—Capt. (Caleb) Brewster returned from one of his customary cruises &amp; brought
                     news that they had killed Gorham Smith of a party that attempted to take their Boats
                     &amp; lost one of their own taken prisoner.

                  <p>About this time a large number of Privateers from 4 to 12 Guns of the Enemy's &amp;
                     ours are cruising in the Sound &amp; take almost every unarmd Vessel that enters it—and

                  <p>It was customary for the enemy to come from L. Island in Whaleboats (sharp at each
                     end
                     and manned with 8 to 10 oars) These, under cover of night, might be drawn up into
                     some
                     unfrequented nook while the rascals plundered &amp; if pursued they could crawl off
                     &amp; soon be out of gunshot. Sometimes they would bring British goods and among them
                     a
                     species of velvet called Corduroy, from which this was long called the Corduroy

                     Brewster reserving his fire till within 8 or 10 rods of Hoyt, poured in a broadside
                     &amp; then another &amp; boarded; there was a large Irishman in the enemy's boat, who
                     walked several times fore and aft, brandishing his broad- sword till Hasselton, a
                     mighty
                     fellow from the State of Massachusetts, snatched it from him &amp; cut his throat from
