               questioned Sheldon, who had commanded one of the regiments on that abortive tour of
               duty. Sheldon replied that he knew nothing of the terms on which they were ordered
               to New York. Further, he said that he had let Seymour know that he would never make
               any demands upon the public for his service. Indeed, he was of the opinion that the
               Light Horse was indebted to their country for quitting their service in so scandalous
               a manner. Washington was forced to defer a decision until such time as he could get
               his papers together.

               Seymour noted that one man had been killed and three men wounded in a skirmish with
               Tories and Indians at Schoharie. The wounded were in the hospital at Albany. Seymour
               also listed two deserters, but whether they had run from the enemy or had simply tired
               of soldiering he did not state. De Vernejoux was reported absent, sick at Albany,
               while Sergeant Wetmore with the drill sergeant and two men were absent by command
               of the Captain. Another man sent as an express to Peekskill by De Vernejoux was still
               absent. One corporal and four men, though expected hourly, had never joined the troop.
               Trumpeter John Conley was present sick. These losses and absences left Seymour with
               one comet, four corporals, and fourteen privates present and fit for duty. Six of
               their twenty-one horses were unfit. A note on the report stated that most of the horses
               were much worn down by hard service.

               about ten or twelve of his dragoons and formed up on the road. A noncom was sent back

               more numerous Redcoats, especially after they leaped the fences and got on his flanks.
               He withdrew, intending to circle into the Germantown road to resume the fight. He
               was pursued only a short distance. The British returned to his vacated quarters in

               at headquarters, and of meanly giving up the fairest pretensions to rank in the army.
