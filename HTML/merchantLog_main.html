         <p>Black Rock became the official Port of Entry for Fairfield County in 1790 and its
            merchants played a significant role in the economic development of New England. One of
            the most successful Black Rock merchants and sea captains who also traded in the West
            Indies, was Thomas Bartram. Everything he did was so successful that it was said to turn
            to gold. And yet, little is known about him and the great fortune he created. The Thomas
            Bartram merchant project involves digitizing the original manuscripts and transcribing
            the documents for study and discovery of what life was like then.</p>
         <h3>Where do the funds go?</h3>
         <p>We greatly appreciate <a
               href="https://www.gofundme.com/thomas-bartram-merchant-log-book">donations</a>. We
            are doing a pay-as-you-go instead or raising the full amount needed. It costs
            approximately $200 to put 100 lines of script text online.</p>
         <h4>Breakdown:</h4>
         <ul>
            <li>$100 to transcribe 100 lines of text pages</li>
            <li>$100 for computer code person to put online</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>What's special about this project?</h3>
         <p> We are not only just putting online, but we are using scholarly tools which conform to
            the best practices. All text online uses the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml"
               >Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> to represent the text in digital form to ensure
            encoding methods that allow for optimal machine-readable texts. This means that our work
            becomes searchable online in the best possible manner and allows for students and
            scholars to continue to explore Black Rock history and culture. </p>
         <h4>The project involves the following steps:</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Digitization</li>
            <li>Transcribing</li>
            <li>Coding (in XML programming <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a>)</li>
            <li>Creating a summary for every page</li>
            <li>Creating a narrative story</li>
            <li>Create lesson plans</li>
            <li>Marketing including <a href="http://www.historydayct.org/">Connecticut History
                  Day</a></li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Meet Our Team:</h3>
         <p>Robert is the project leader on this project. He is the founder of <a
               href="http://www.blackrockhistory.net/">blackrockhistory.net</a> and has other
            projects underway which also need funding. Robert has been involved with creating online
            exhibits for many years. His work contributed to the State of Connecticut signing into
            law that Bridgeport's aviation engineer was '<a href="http://firstinflight.info/">first
               in flight</a>' instead of the Wright brothers. His motivation to lead this project:
            "there is so much to learn about local history, especially when we apply new digital
            tools. And in some cases history will need to be re-written as it was after Gustave
            Whitehead."</p>
         <p>Rebecca Parker is our encoder. She graduated with a B.A. in English Literature and
            Social Science and received a certificate in Digital Studies from the University of
            Pittsburgh at Greensburg. She was employed at <a
               href="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/digital-humanities/center-digital-text"
               >Pitt-Greensburg's Center for the Digital Text</a>, and is currently getting her M.A.
            in Digital Humanities at Loyola University Chicago.</p>
         <p>Susan and Beth are our transcribers. They are members of the DAR local chapter and have
            years of experience transcribing. They are members of the Genealogy Roundtable which
            meets at the Pequot Library in Southport, CT on a regular basis. They are also
            descendents of many of the people mentioned in the merchant log books.</p>
         <p>Max is our jQuery/JavaScript person, who for example implemented the magnifying glass
            function to allow for closeups of the manuscripts with just a mouse over.</p>
         <p>Larissa is a volunteer and provides summaries of the manuscript text after it is
            transcribed, coded and appears online.</p>
