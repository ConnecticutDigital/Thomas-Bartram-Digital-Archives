      <h2 class="heading">The Black Rock Harbor Historic District</h2>
      <p> BlackRockHistory.net seeks to educate and promote preservation of the houses and architecture
         of the historic seaside village of Black Rock. This is also the mandate of the <a
            href="http://www.bridgeportct.gov/filestorage/89019/89751/94961/103639/MasterPlanofConservationandDevelopment.pdf">Master
            Plan</a> of Bridgeport (see below). Today there is still a need to provide the
         public with an
         easily accessible information database of the houses and architecture of the
         original historic
         district. While there are many more houses on the National Register in Black
         Rock, this site
         is devoted to the original list.  The Black Rock Historic District
         is roughly bounded by Black Rock Harbor, Grovers Avenue,
         Beacon and Prescott Streets. It contains 302 acres and today has a total of
         109 buildings.

      <p>WHAT IS A HISTORIC DISTRICT: a group of buildings, properties,
         or sites that have been designated by
         one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally
         significant.
         The U.S. federal government designates historic districts through the United
         States Department
         of Interior under the auspices of the National Park Service. Federally designated
         historic
         districts are listed on the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb15/nrb15_4.htm">National Register of Historic Places</a>. The 
         application for the Black Rock historic district was
         entered into the National Register of Historic Places on March 15,
         1979.
         
      </p>
      <p> Bridgeport has 24 HISTORIC DISTRICTS comprising both local districts and those listed on
         the National Register of Historic Places. </p>
      <p>Black Rock was the first historic district to be
         created. This is why it appears as number one on the list.</p>
