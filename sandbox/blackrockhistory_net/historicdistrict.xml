        <national_register>One of the village's earliest Victorian, style structures, this double
            house shows Gothic Revival influence in its vertical lines. It is 1 1/2 stories high
            with entrances in opposite projecting wings at the sides. An unusual eight pointed attic
            window dates from the reconstruction following a circa 1910 fire.</national_register>

        <national_register>This house, a flat roof Italian villa, consists of a central projecting

        <walking_tour_book>The schooner Ella Jane was the fastest packet boat on the Long Island

            floor-t0-ceiling parlor windows. (This house was originally identical in appearance to
            the Isaac Jones Houses, which were remodeled around 1910. )</walking_tour_book>

        <style>Italian-Gothic</style>
        <national_register>Black Rock's most impressive Early Victorian house was built at the top
            of a small hill overlooking the shipyards on the point (operated by the original owner).
            It is 2 1/2 stories high and three bays wide with a side gable roof. There is a
            bracketed cornice and a sharp Gothic gable in the front centered, over the doorway. It
            contains a circular window. Under it on the second floor is a. triple arch false
            Palladian window composed of blind louvres with a square window in the center. Paired
            4/4 windows are used throughout the house. It has been little altered since the time of
            its construction (an additional front entrance was constructed to serve the second floor
            when it became a two-family at the time of the First World War).</national_register>
        <walking_tour_book>The village showplace of the ante-bellum period, this Italianate-Gothic
            mansion was built by the owner of a shipyard. It's design, probably influenced by a plan
            published in A.J. Downing's architecture of Country Houses, an early builder's handbook,
            is similar to houses on Fairfield's Old Post Road.</walking_tour_book>

        <national_register>This house is the village's most resplendent example of the Italian villa
            style. The Palladian window in the front pavilion, comprised of false louvres
            surrounding a regular size 6/6 window, is similar to others still to be seen in Black
            Rock (notably on the Captain William Hall House) and In Fairfield. Below it, a double
            French window surmounted by a heavy drip cap with wooden wave 'motif decoration opens
            onto a three-sided veranda. </national_register>
        <walking_tour_book>Built for a shipyard and marine railway owner, this flamboyant Italianate
            house has suffered few alterations over the years. While no larger than contemporary

            new kitchen wing built at the west side. The interior woodwork was also updated at this

            a quatrefoil window was added in the 1850s, The chimney from the first floor up was
            removed and the front fenestration altered in the 1940s, and the front wall has recently
            been resided with wood shingles and vertical sheathing boards. The side wing, originally
            a 1 1/2story appendage (probably a summer kitchen), was raised to its present 2

            were shipped from here to New York and the West Indies. The factory was converted into a
            dwelling about 1870.</walking_tour_book>

        <national_register>This double Mansard villa was built facing the harbor for two brothers
            who were perhaps the most prolific homebuilders in Bridgeport in the late nineteenth
            century. It was very similar in design to the George Hotel (demolished), a large
            hostelry located on. the water about a half mile away, which was built by the Gould
            Brothers in 1876, The house is 2 1/2 stories high, symmetrical, with flanking one story
            wings and a delicate piazza supported by Corinthian columns (these columns are curiously
            similar to the lionic ones on the Wolcott Chauncey House across the street, and may have
            been an early expression of Colonial Revivalism). The original patterned slate roof with
            iron cresting replaced by asphalt shingles. </national_register>

        <national_register>Built as part of a wharf development at the foot of Beacon Street and

            central, chimney. The exterior retains its early wide clapboards and an elaborate
            Adamesque portico supported by Ionic columns with carved wood capitals. The window sash
            was changed to 2/2 in the late 19th century. The interior staircase to the second floor,
            apparently original, is located against the outside wall in the southwest corner of the
            front parlor</national_register>
        <walking_tour_book>This house is a valuable survivor of a lower class 18th century dwelling.
            Most other examples disappeared during the 19th century when colonial architecture was
            held in low esteem. The property belonged to Mr. George A. Wells, and we understand he
            is congratulating himself upon the disposition of it." The Chauncey House was the
            birthplace of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, the American Forces commander of the Great Lakes
            War of 1812.</walking_tour_book>
