      <h2 class="heading">Black Rock Harbor Historic District</h2>
      <p> The Black Rock National Register District includes the remains of the village of
         Black Rock, third most important seaport in Connecticut after the Revolutionary
         War - and important shipbuilding center in the years immediately preceding the
         Civil War. It includes examples of every major American architectural style from
         the late Medieval of the seventeenth century to the Italianate of the
         mid-nineteenth, as well as some resort and suburban styles of the later
         Victorian era.
      </p>
      <p>Black Rock was made a Port of Entry for all of Western Connecticut in, 1790. A
         government lighthouse was built at the mouth of the harbor in 1807, and a
         turnpike laid out to Danbury in 1812. By 1830, however, Bridgeport begins to
         surpass Black Rock's place as the center of eastern Fairfield County commerce.
         At this time the village turned to ship and carriage building as a means of
         livelihood.
