               <p>This severely altered house may date back to the seventeenth century
                  although a 1720 date has traditionally been ascribed to it. The roof pitch is in excess
                  of 60 degrees; the framing timbers (including a 22 inch wide summer beam) are exposed
                  on
                  the interior and reveal the great age of the house, A Gothic Revival central gable
                  with
                  a quatrefoil window was added in the 1850s, The chimney from the first floor up was
                  removed and the front fenestration altered in the 1940s, and the front wall has recently
                  been resided with wood shingles and vertical sheathing boards. The side wing, originally
                  a 1 1/2story appendage (probably a summer kitchen), was raised to its present 2
                  1/2-story height in the late 19th century.

               <p>Built as part of a wharf development at the foot of Beacon Street and
                  moved to its present site around 1840, this house is a modest one story structure
                  with a
                  central, chimney. The exterior retains its early wide clapboards and an elaborate
                  Adamesque portico supported by Ionic columns with carved wood capitals. The window
                  sash
                  was changed to 2/2 in the late 19th century. The interior staircase to the second
                  floor,
                  apparently original, is located against the outside wall in the southwest corner of

               <p>This house is a valuable survivor of a lower class 18th century dwelling.
                  Most other examples disappeared during the 19th century when colonial architecture
                  was
                  held in low esteem. The property belonged to Mr. George A. Wells, and we understand
                  he
                  is congratulating himself upon the disposition of it." The Chauncey House was the
                  birthplace of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, the American Forces commander of the Great
                  Lakes

                  of this style. A Doric order portico was added across the front with flush board siding
                  underneath, the end gables finished, as pediments with a simple, wide entablature,
                  and a

               <p>Built in an unusual L-shape, this transitional Greek Revival Early
                  Victorian house has an ornamented veranda part way across its front. It remains in
                  virtually pristine condition (a modern wing extends across the
                  rear).
               </p>
               <p>This modest Early Victorian cottage was built by a ship's carpenter and
                  still remains in the hands of his descendants.
               </p>
               <p>Sturges W. Seeley (1825-1905) was a shipbuilder in the Black Rock shipyards.
                  He bought his property from William Wheeler. Martha Seeler Harrison lived there
                  (1858-1923). The Harrison family took over the Black Rock turpentine factory and
                  operated it until it burned in 1880.

               <p>Erected the same year as the second Arthur Smith House (118 Ellsworth
                  Street) and on an adjoining lot, this house is essentially a scaled-down version of
                  its
                  neighbor. It lacks the tower and has a veranda only across the
                  front.

               <p>Built by the Gould Brothers, local builders who lived in Black Rock (see
                  listing for their house at 119-21 Seabright Avenue), this Shingle Style suburban house
                  is 2j stories high with a wrap-around veranda and a corner octagonal tower. The first
                  floor is sided with clapboards, the second floor with novelty
                  shingles.

               <p>Mr. Smith was born in 1847 and went to sea at an early age. He became a
                  captain at 17 of a two-masted schooner in the New England trade. He later went into
                  the
                  coal business and then began the Smith's Express which he carried on until his death.
                  Arthur Smith was son of Elizabeth Allen and David Smith (who was a builder and built
                  many houses in Black Rock.
