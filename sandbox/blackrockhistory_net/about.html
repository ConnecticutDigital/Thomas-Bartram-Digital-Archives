      <h2 class="heading">The Black Rock National Register District</h2>
      <p> This project's goal is to raise awareness about the seaside village of Black
         Rock, Connecticut. The historic distrcit is located at the head of Black
         Rock Harbor in the City of Bridgeport, approximately two and one-half miles
         southwest, of downtown. The area within the district boundaries comprises
         the residential section of an eighteenth' and nineteenth century
         seaport/shipbuilding center as delineated by old maps and surviving
         architectural evidence.
      </p>
      <p>Included are two pre-Revolutionary houses, a Federal Greek Revival housing
         and manufacturing development, and an early Victorian, shipbuilding
         community interspersed with compatible late nineteenth and twentieth century
         structures constructed after the village had become incorporated into the
         larger urban center. The area surrounding the district is an urban
         residential neighborhood of twentieth century one- and two-family houses.
         The district is sited on a coastal plain with a gentle slope up to a small
         hill on Ellsworth Street.
