            <p> 1630-1772 [The first page includes genealogical notes on the Wheeler family, which
               have
               been arranged in the "Family Index."]
            </p>
            <p> The first Wheeler that came into America settled in Con- cord (Massachusetts) about
               the
               year 1630. He had several sons &amp; one of them came to Black Rock and at the old Lot
               built a stone house with a flat roof of Plank on which he mounted two four-pounders,—one
               pointed towards the Mouth of the Harbor &amp; the other at an Indian fort situated at
               the
               head of the harbor, now known by the name of Old Fort.
            </p>
            <p>This place the Fairfield Indians had built for their defence against some of the interior
               tribes with whom they were perpetually at War. It was composed of Palisades joined
               together &amp; at each corner a room was built out with portholes like the following
               figure: 
               
            </p>
            <p> It contained about an acre of land &amp; was garrisoned by about 200 Indians fond of
               War
               &amp; often solliciting the Old Indian for leave to destroy the English. Once they
               obtained it on condition of pulling up a large neighboring White Oak Tree-
            </p>
            <p> Well, to work they went &amp; stript off its branches, but still the trunk baffled their
               utmost endeavours.
            </p>
            <p>"Thus" says the Old , "will be the end of your War—you may kill some of their papooses,
               but the old plaguey Stump t'other side of the great Waters will remain &amp; send out
               more
               branches—" 
            </p>
            <p> It happened one time that 6 of the Mohawk tribe, being closely pursued by the Fairfield
               Indians were secreted by one of the Waklins of Stratfield under some sheaves of Flax,
               &amp; being directed homewards, were the occasion of the long Amity that subsisted between
               that tribe and the English.—
            </p>
            <p> Many remains of the Indians are daily discovered, as Stone arrows, hatchets, etc.
               In
               Greenfield is a Samp Mortar made in the solid rock, containing nearly half a Bushel.
               
            </p>
            <p> A pot has been seen in Weston of Stone &amp; a stone bottle was found very curiously
               made, holding about half a pint, at Black Rock some years since. A great part of their
               food seems to have been Oysters, Clams &amp;c. by the vast beds of Shells that are
               frequently dug out of the Earth. 
            </p>
            <p> My Grandfather had (I learn from tradition, there being no journals left of those
               times)
               many brothers &amp; sisters, 14 in all. 
            </p>
            <p> Hannah, the youngest, was a very intelligent person— about 18 years of age. She was
               courted &amp; expected to be married to Ringfield a Captain of a ship who gave her a gold
               ring, 3 pair of green silk stockings &amp;c, but he being gone for so long, she was
               courted &amp; married by Sam Wheeler. 
            </p>
            <p> On the day of their marriage, a Ship appearing taken for Ringfield by the Bride,
               she
               burst into tears &amp; declared she would not be married, &amp; half dressed hid in a hole
               in the back kitchen of my grandfather who, with horsewhip in hand, dragged her out,
               but
               she ran around him as he attempted to strike.—
            </p>
            <p>They finally concluded to dispatch a boat to see who com- manded said ship. Finding
               it
               was not Ringfield (who was lost) she was married, but never could the Capt. be erased
               from
               her mind, as (I am told by a person who was eye wit- ness) she used frequently at
               75 years
               of age to weep over his presents.
