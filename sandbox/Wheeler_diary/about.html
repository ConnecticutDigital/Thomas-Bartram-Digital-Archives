            <!--<div class="about"> --> <p class="about">The Journal of William Wheeler Diary Project is a collaborative effort by local history scholars to increase accessibility to the earliest historic text of Black Rock, Connecticut. The project seeks to first put the diary online and then to create a list of all early residents in Black Rock and how they are related and what roles they played. Black Rock was the main port of Fairfield. Brewster Street was Main Street. The diary has much information about Black Rock's earliest history.    </p>
            
            <p class="about">The DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) chapter in Fairfield was instrumental in not only preserving this document, but also in creating detailed documentation of the earliest residents. The DAR provides genealogical notes throughout the book. In fact, for someone first reading the book, it may not be clear which is the original diary and which parts the DAR has written. </p>
                
            <h3 class="about" style="text-align:center;">Why Should We Care About The Wheeler diary? </h3>
                
            <p class="about">It is the earliest history since the period following the Pequot War of 1637: the 'first families' of Fairfield, mercantile and shipping activities, church history, and the key role Black Rock played during the American Revolution such as who operated the canons at St. Mary's By the Sea which kept the British ships away, and George Washington's <a href="http://www.blackrockhistory.org/">Black Rock spy</a> who helped win the Revolutionary War. The diary also serves as a microcosm of life in early colonial New England. The project's goal is to generate more awareness, increase accessibility of the manuscript, and possibly raise new questions on local and New England history. </p>
            
            <p class="about">Many have heard about this diary. Few have read it. And little or no work has been done to analyze the data to make it more understandable and available to students, scholars and the general public. We seek to extract the data and information and make it more understandable. There are many stories to tell. And for people who live in Black Rock, living in the historic 'Seaport of Old Fairfied', there are many stories to be told. This is the first web site to make this diary available online and we need volunteers to finish the online diary and genealogy database.  We need to review and correct the text in the data scrub of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a> scanned text. </p>
                
            <p class="about">The project was created by Robert Foley, founder of the Bridgeport Digital Humanities Initiative. Mr. Foley, a Black Rock resident, began the site because he couldn't find the diary anywhere online.
