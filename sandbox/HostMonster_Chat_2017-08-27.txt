Is asp.net installed on our server? If not is their capability to add it?

N
Hello ,I am sorry for the wait time. My name is Nishmitha and I am happy to help you. How are you today?

R
Fine. 
Is asp.net installed on our server? If not is their capability to add it?

N
Sorry its not installed 
WE have linux hosting and asp.net needs window hosting

R
ok. what is the best way for me to add a content form to my site where the content filled out from a site visitor can then be sent to my email?
can you send me to a resource to develop the code that works with what the server has installed?

N
you can use any contact form for that 

R
is there a way to run aspx code on our server?

N
Sorry its not possible on our server

R
Ok so how about node.js ?

N
It is installed on VPs server not on your current shared hosting 
You can upgrade your account from shared to VPS

R
so node mailer package is not installed on the space I currently have?
What are the options I have with my current space?
you said any contact form and I have now listed two that you are saying are not available for me
so be best if you could just point me to a resource that will walk me through creating a content form that will work on my current space

N
in your current plan you can use any contact form plugins or scripts so that the user can subscribe to your website and you will get email notification 

R
So my current space would not work to create something like this: http://projects.myasp.info/Contact_us.aspx

N
Please hold on

R
Okay I was just unsure if we had lost connection 

N
Sorry its not possible to create any asp.net files in our server
however you can use any contact for or scripts to receive the notification from user

R
but not node.js
either
i dont just want a notification I would want the content from the form filled out by the user sent to ,e
*me

N
node.js can be installed on VPs server where you get root access to the server 
But currently you are in shared hosting 

R
thank you. have a good day.

N
You are welcome
